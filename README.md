# Small Datalog Interpreter

This project aims to create a small interpreter for the Datalog programming language.

Datalog is a declarative and logic language based on Horn clauses, aimed at solving problems via deduction.

This project implements a stable, iterative and space bound algorithm of unification of free variables, in depth-first search.

**For now this project will be implemented in Ruby for fast prototyping and reiteration.** Once stable, it will be reimplemented in a more efficient language.

You can read more about Datalog in general in this [external document](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/ramsdell/tools/datalog/datalog.html#Introduction).
