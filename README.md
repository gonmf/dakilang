# Small Datalog Interpreter

This project aims to create a small interpreter for the Datalog programming language.

Datalog is a declarative and logic language based on Horn clauses and reification, to allow the efficient resolution of logic problems via deduction.

**For now this project will be implemented in Ruby for fast prototyping and reiteration.** Once stable, it will be reimplemented in a more efficient language.

You can read more about Datalog in this [external document](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/ramsdell/tools/datalog/datalog.html#Introduction).
