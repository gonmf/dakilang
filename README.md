# Daki Language Interpreter

Daki is a small computer programming language similar to Prolog and Datalog. This is it's first concept implementation, and therefore features an interpreter instead of a compiler.

**For now this project will be implemented in Ruby for fast prototyping and reiteration.**

Daki is a declarative and logic language based on Horn clauses, aimed at solving problems via deduction.

This project implements a stable, iterative and space bound algorithm of unification of free variables, in depth-first search. At this point, the implementation details and algorithm are subject to change.

Regardless of your familarity with Prolog or Datalog, Daki language has significant differences and omissions from both, also being a work in progress, so I have compiled the following language definition, structured by example.
